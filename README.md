# 2d-strategy-game

This is a 2d strategy game.

Assumptions:
* [x]when creating a new game, the map is randomly generated,
* [x]you cannot directly control a single character. You can only give global orders, e.g. build a wall, cut down a given tree, etc. then the nearest free (not doing anything at the moment) character should take care of it,
* [x]the main goal of the game is to keep the population alive,
* [ ]sometimes random events happen, e.g. attack of evil units, bad weather, etc.,
* [ ]climatic conditions may change,
* [x]trees from time to time grow back in any place and grow with time.
